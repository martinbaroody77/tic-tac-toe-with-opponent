A tic tac toe with an opponent AI which uses recursion to choose priorities.

To run the program, run the "TicTacToe.java" file.

I haven't added a UI for this program yet, so the game is played through the command line. The locations of the grid are represented with the following numbers:

00  01  02
10  11  12
20  21  22

To play at the desired location, enter the corresponding number as shown above.
